# Tethealla Login Manager
A GUI companion tool for Tethealla (https://pioneer2.net) Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst servers that allows the management (start, stop, and restart) of its patch and login servers, as well as their config files!

# Building and Usage
To build, open the .sln file in Visual Studio.

Place login_manager.exe in the same directory as login_server.exe and run. Default settings will be loaded if any config files were not found. Minimizing will minimize the window to the system tray, and closing login_manager.exe will also close both login_server.exe and patch_server.exe.
